This is a simple multiplayer game I made with Java sockets. here 2 players can connect to one server and play online.

I included both server and client apps on the same project,

How to Play Online?

you need a small VPS server to host your server application. replace the server IP in the client application and that's it you are good to go .

feel free to change the code and add more functions to it. I made this to learn about Java sockets, maybe I will update it later, if you don't want to complie and do the stuff I already did it for you check the release section (the release only works locally I haven't added a VPS to it).
