This is a simple Multiplaer game I made with Java sockets . here 2 players can connect to a one server and play online .

I included both server and client apps on the same project,

How to Play Online?

you need a small VPS server to host your server application. replace the server IP in the client  application and thats it you are good to go .

feel free chage the code and add more functions in to it . I made this to learn about Java sockets , maybe I will update it later , if you don't want to complie and do the stuff I already did it for you check the release section (release only works localy I have't added a VPS to it).
